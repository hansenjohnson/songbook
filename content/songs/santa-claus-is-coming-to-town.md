   C                        F
You better watch out, you'd better not cry,
   C                       F
you'd better not pout, I'm telling you why,
C    Am       Dm        G C
Santa Claus is coming to town
       C               F
He's making a list and checking it twice,
C                      F               
gonna find out who's naughty and nice, 
C     Am       Dm        G C
Santa Claus is coming to town.


    F                                                       F7
He sees you when you're sleeping, and he knows when you're awake
     D7                 G                  D7                G     G7
he knows if you've been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake. Oh
      C                       F
you'd better watch out, you'd better not cry,
      C                   F                
you'd better not pout I'm telling you why, 
C     Am       Dm       G C
Santa Claus is coming to town.


       C                  F
With little tin horns and little toy drums,
       C                    F
with root-ti-toot-toots and rummy-tum-tums.
  C     Am       Dm       G C
Santa Claus is coming to town.
      C                      F
And curley-haired dolls that cuddle and coo,
C                    F
elephants, boats and kiddy-cars too.
C     Am       Dm       G C
Santa Claus is coming to town.


    F                                        F7
The kids in girl and boy town - will have a jubilee
          D7          G                    D7                  G    G7
they're gonna build a toy land town - all around the christmas tree, so
      C                     F
you better watch out, you'd better not cry
      C                   F
you'd better not pout I'm telling you why.
   C   Am      Dm
Santa Claus is coming
   C   Am      Dm
Santa Claus is coming
   C   Am      Dm      G C
Santa Claus is coming to town
