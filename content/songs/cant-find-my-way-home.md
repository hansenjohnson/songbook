```
      D/C           D/B         D/Bb            D
Come down off your throne and leave your body alone
F     G         Dsus
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting so long
Somebody holds the key

          G                 A                   D
But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
          F          G                  D
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home

Come down on your own and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting all these years
Somebody holds the key

But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home

But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
Still I can't find my way home
And I've done nothing wrong
But I can't find my way home
```
