[Verse 1]
     Am
You remind me of a Sunday
Am/B  C
Back home in old Kentucky
           G                 F              C
With the church choirs just beltin' to the pines
      Am
And I love you like the mountains
Am/B     C
Love the way the mornin' opens
      G              F                   C   Csus  C
To a soft and bright greetin' from the sun

[Chorus]
                F          G   C/G   G
So if it'd make you stay
                  Am
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
Am/B       C
I wouldn't keep it all inside
                G               F                C   Csus  C
and I'd let you know how much I loved you every day
     F               C          G                   Am        Am/B     G     
So, darlin' will you stay right here and shake this frost off of my bones

[Verse 2]

Well, I used to ride a mustang
And I'd run that thing on high hopes
'Til they raised the price of dreams so high I couldn't pay
So I let that car just sit there
when I should've took you drivin'
windows down, while the music played

[Chorus]

[Outro]
    F               C          G                   Am       Am/B     G     
So darlin' will you stay right here and shake this frost off of my bones
C/G  G
