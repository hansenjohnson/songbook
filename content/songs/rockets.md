Capo 2

[all open sus chords; relative to capo]

D walkdown riff

D                 F#m              G
Holding the fire, standing in the rain
D                 F#m           G
Eyes of desire, close to the flame
              Em                     D              
nothing can be done, to change their minds

Out in the dark, far beyond the light.
Home is with the stars, out of sight.
Nothing can be done, to make them stay.

Em      F#m           Bm  
Here and then they're gone
    A       G       Em
How long until they go
    A       G       Em
How long until they know
                  D
All they need to fly
        A       G     Bm   D
Rockets to the silver sky

If I had the chance to do it all again
I'd follow every stream, fearless like them
Let everything be done, in it's own time

Don't worry if it's wrong
How long until I go
How long until I know
All I need to fly
Rocket to the silver sky
