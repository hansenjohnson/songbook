A riff (x4)

A                          D                             A riff
Well I sure as hell didn't love her this much when I met her
A                            D              A riff    
Much as I was just captured again and again
D/A                     E/A                    A riff   
She could turn her eyes away and still hold me under
D/A                     E/A               A riff
A river of beauty and mystery pulling me in

And then when she told me her name I knew I would die slowly
I knew I was destined to live with this pain every night
For each night I stand with my father playing our music
We cry out her name and her memory under the lights

                  D                       A riff
And each night I pray, I'll forget about Georgia
A                                                      D
She'll never love me like I know a love's supposed to be
               D                       A riff
Each night I pray, I'll forget about Georgia
       D/A                     E/A               A riff
But a part of me hopes that she'll never forget about me
       D/A                     E/A               A riff
Oh, a part of me hopes that she'll never forget about me

A riff (x4)

We made love for the first time in a hotel in San Francisco
A night so perfect I try to forget about it now
And Ray Charles is singing her name like rain on my window
And I want to release  her but I can't begin to know how

So I say Ray, let me forget about Georgia
Because she'll never love me like I know a love's supposed to be
I say Ray, let me forget about Georgia
But a part of me hopes that she'll never forget about me
Oh, a part of me hopes that she'll never forget about me

So I say Ray, let me forget about Georgia
Because she'll never love me like I know a love's supposed to be
I pray, I'll forget about Georgia
But a part of me hopes that she'll never forget about me
Oh, a part of me hopes that she'll never forget about me
A part of me hopes that she'll never forget about me
