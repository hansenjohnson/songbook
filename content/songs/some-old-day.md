G
I’ve been workin’ out in the rain
            C                   G   
Tied to the dirty old ball and chain
                        A              D
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day
            G                 
Some sweet day the’ll turn me loose
          C          G
From this dirty old calaboose
                         A             G     G7
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day

Chorus

   C
   Some old day
                           G
   You’ll wait for me and pray
                            A             D  D7
   Oh dear mother i’ll come home some old day
               G                 G7
   Some sweet day the’ll turn me loose
             C          G
   From this dirty old calaboose
                            A             G
   Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day

Oh dear mother I’ve hurt you so
I’ve been cruel to you I know
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day
Tell my brother My sister and dad
Tell the dear friends that I’ve had
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day
