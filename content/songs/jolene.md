G
Cocaine flame in my bloodstream
G
Sold my coat when I hit Spokane
C               
Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes
C                     G  
in the early morning rain
 
G           
Lately my hands they don't feel like mine
G           
My eyes been stung with dust and blind
C              
Held you in my arms one time
C                 G     G  D/F#
Lost you just the same
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em    G    C          G    D/F#
   Jolene... I ain't about to go
Em      G           C         C
  straight... It's too late
 
 
[Verse]
 
G          
I found myself face down in a ditch
D                    
Booze in my hair and blood on my lips
C                        
A picture of you holding a picture of me
C                        G       G  D/F#
In the pocket of my blue jeans
 
Em              G         C          C
I still don't know what love means
Em          G         C     G/B    Am
Still don't know what love means
  G             C     G/B   Am
Jolene... La la la la la la la
  G      
Jolene...
 
G
Been so long since I seen your face
G      
Or felt a part of this human race
C                  
I've been living out of this here suitcase
C           G
for way too long
 
G                            
A man needs something he can hold onto
G 
A nine pound hammer or a woman like you
C                              G    G D/F#
Either one of them things will do
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Jolene... I ain't about to go
straight... It's too late
  
[Verse]

I found myself face down in a ditch
Booze in my hair and blood on my lips
A picture of you holding a picture of me
In the pocket of my blue jeans
 
I still don't know what love means
Still don't know what love means
 
 
[Outro]
 
  G             C     G/B   Am
Jolene... La la la la la la la
  G             C     G/B   Am
Jolene... La la la la na na na
  G      
Jolene...
