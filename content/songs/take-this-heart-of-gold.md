[Intro]
Am (B) C (G) F
C Am G
Am (B) C (G) F
Am G F

[Chorus]
Am                  C                F
Take this heart of gold, and melt it down
                C
And I'll come around
            G
I'll come around
                Am             C
I'm treadin' lightly in your eyes 
          F      
And honey I can't live a lie
        Am          G                F
But a life without you could never steal me now

Am G F

[Verse 1]
C
With so much time to spend
      F
Why paint this house again?
          C                                        G
When the floorboards creak and pull you from your slumber
         Am                C
Well I'd hold you 'til the end
           F
But honey even oaks must bend
        Am       G              F
If we intend to stick with one another

[Chorus]
So take this heart of gold, and melt it down
And I'll come around
I'll come around
I'm treadin' lightly in your eyes
And honey I can't live a lie
But a life without you could never steal me now

Am G F [or repeat intro]

[Verse 2]
Out the door, and down the drive
There's a part of me that tries
To keep that highway's call to me away
And another, further still
That sadly never will
Feel at home, no matter how long I may stay

[Chorus]
So take this heart of gold, and melt it down
And I'll come around
I'll come around
I'm treadin' lightly in your eyes
And honey I can't live a lie
But a life without you could never steal me now
