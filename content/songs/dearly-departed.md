G Em C G F#
Oooooh [x4]

Chorus:
G         Em                 C        G          F# 
You and I both know that the house is haunted
And you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to catch me in your bed sheets just rattlin your chains
Well back then baby, it didn't seem so strange

D            C               G    F#  G
You used to bite, I used to moan
But now I'm mumbling and you choke
Well it ain't so scary on my own
Tell me honey, what's a dagger without a cloak?

[Chorus]

In the midnight hour you came alive
I was lookin' for my crystal ball
I was busy tryin' to charm that snake ssss
When the sun came up we had no place to hide
And you had to tell your friends that my fangs were fake
I just had to

[Chorus]

Bridge:
Am                G       D
Even when one is dead and gone
It still takes two to make a house a home
Well I'm as lonesome as the catacombs
C
I hear you call my name but no one is there
          D7
Except a feeling in the air

[Chorus]

Yeah, you and I both know
Oooohh
Yeah, you and I both know
Oooohh
Yeah, you and I both know
Oooohh
Oooohh
```
