[Intro]
A   E  B     C#m  B
A   E  B     B

[Verse 1]
A
Photograph of us
     E
In a spotlight
         B
On a hot night
               C#m        B
I was drifting in and out
A                   E
Reticent on the off chance
                   B
I'm blunter than a bullseye
            C#m           B
Begging for peace of mind

[Refrain]
  A              E     B     C#m  B
I get ahead of myself...elf
A                 E        B      C#m  B
Bracing for a bombshell.....ell

[Verse 2]
Your love written on a blank check
Wear it around your neck
I was at a loss
But you come to me on a fault line
Deep inside a goldmine
Hovering like a moth

[Refrain] 0:58
I lose a bit of myself.....elf
Laying out eggshells.....ells

[Chorus]
          E           B
I've been yours for so long
        C#m           A
We come right back,   to it
      E          B
I let my mind run wild
           C#m       A
Don't know why I.... do it
                    E
But you just settle in
       B           C#m   B
Like a song with no end
   A             E
If I can keep up...
          B         C#m    B
We'll get right back to.....oo

[Instrumental]

A   E  B     C#m  B (x2)

[Verse 3]
If I swerve in and out of my lane
Burning up an old flame
Turn a jealous eye
I'll fall down into a fair game
Lick a wound that was not
Ever mine

[Refrain]
[Chorus]
[Instrumental] 
[Chorus]
 
[Outro]
          B         C#m    B  A   E
We'll get right back to.....oo  it
          B         C#m    B
We'll get right back to.....oo
A   E  B     C#m  B (x3)
