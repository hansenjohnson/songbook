Capo 2
C F G

C                                      F
remember when our songs were just like prayers.
     C      G              Am            F
like gospel hymns that you called in the air.
C                          F
come down come down sweet reverence,
C      G        Am        F
unto my simple house and ring, and ring.

C F G

F
ring like silver, ring like gold
     C         G             Am  F
ring out those ghosts on the ohio
ring like clear day wedding bells
were we the belly of the beast or the sword that fell…we’ll never tell.


Em                   F            C
come to me clear and cold on some sea
Em                       F               C
watch the world spinning waves…like some machine

now i’ve been crazy couldn’t you tell
i threw stones at the stars, but the whole sky fell
now i’m covered up in straw, belly up on the table
well i drank and sang, and passed in the stable.

that tall grass grows high and brown,
well i dragged you straight in the muddy ground
and you sent me back to where i roam
well i cursed and i cried, but now i know…now i know

and i ran back to that hollow again
the moon was just a sliver back then
and i ached for my heart like some tin man
when it came oh it beat and it boiled and it rang…it’s ringing

ring like crazy, ring like hell
turn me back into that wild haired gale
ring like silver, ring like gold
turn these diamonds straight back into coal.
