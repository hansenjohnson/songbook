Am7                       Dm7  Em7 F G
Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind
In the garden, I see
West purple shower, bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flower echo from a cherry cloud

F
Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
                                C                   C7
Playgrounds will laugh, If you try to ask, "Is it cool?"
F
If you arrive and don't see me
              D7
I'm going to be

        Em
With my baby
      Dm
I am free
        Em
Flying in her arms
          Dm
Over the sea

Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kite
With velvet roses diggin' freedom flight
A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays
I sit in for a few

F   Am Bb Dm C7
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
