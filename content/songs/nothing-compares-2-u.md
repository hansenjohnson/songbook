Intro: F# B

B                          F#/A#
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
G#m/E                     oct(D# E F# E D#)
Since you took your love away
B                         F#/A#
I go out every night and sleep all day
G#m/E                     oct(D# E F# E D#)
Since you took your love away

Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
G#m/E                                G          
But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues

        A           (E/B)
'Cause nothing compares
A                   B
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong

I could put my arms around every girl I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me?
(Guess what he told me?)
He said boy you better try to have fun
No matter what you do, but he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[solo]

All the flowers that you planted mama, in the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
```
