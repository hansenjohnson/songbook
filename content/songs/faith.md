Well I guess it would be nice
B
If I could touch your body
            E
I know not everybody
                    B
Has got a body like you

But I've got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

          E                       B
Oh but I need some time off from that emotion
E                                 B         
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
              E       
Oh when that love comes down
B         G#7
Without devotion
          C#m7
Well it takes a strong man baby
        F#
But I'm showing you the door

‘Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith

Baby,
I know you're asking me to stay
Say please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh oh baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Yes I've gotta have faith…
Mmm, I gotta have faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith-a-faith-a-faith

Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh oh baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Cause I gotta have faith
Mmm I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith-a-faith-a-faith
I gotta have faith-a-faith-a-faith
```
