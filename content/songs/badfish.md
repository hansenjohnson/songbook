A                       Bm7
When you grab a hold of me
G                                A
Tell me that I'll never be set free
But I'm a parasite,
Creep and crawl I step into the night.
Two pints of booze
Tell me are you a badfish too?
Are you a badfish too?

D                       A
Ain't got no money to spend
D                           A
I hope the night will never end
D                A
Lord knows I'm weak
D                 A                 E
Won't somebody get me off of this reef

Baby you're a big blue whale
Grab the reef when all duck diving fails
I swim, but wish I'd never learned
The water's too polluted with the germs
I dive deep when it's ten feet overhead
Grab the reef underneath my bed (it's underneath my bed)

Ain't got no quarrels with God
Ain't got no time to grow old
Lord knows I'm weak
Won't somebody get me off of this reef

[Solo]

Ain't got no quarrels with God
Ain't got no time to get old
Lord knows I'm weak
Won't somebody get me off of this reef
