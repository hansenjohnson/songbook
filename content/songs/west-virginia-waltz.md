Capo 4

[Verse 1]
C                       F             C
In coal minin' country, green rollin' hills
C                                  G        C
Where my true love is waitin', for he loves me
I had to go with my ramblin' ways
I'm always thinkin' of him, for the sweet love we made

[Chorus]
Am                                 C            Am
The last time I saw him we did the West Virginia waltz
    C             Am       
The West Virginia waltz
F               G       C
No-one holds a flame to you

[Verse 2]
So I came back home, with what treasures I had made
Just to be your lovin' wife, with kids on the way
So I found your road then I ran to your gate
I was calling out your name but now you sleep under the clay

[Chorus x2]
