[Intro]
Fmaj7 Gm/C

                        Bbmaj7
I am a lineman for the county
Am                     Gm/C   
And I drive the main road
Dm7              Am7     G            D
Searchin' in the sun for another overload

                           G/C 
I hear you singing in the wire
                            G/B
I can hear you through the whine
G/Bb                D     A
And the Wichita lineman

                Bbsus   Csus
Is still on the line

[Break]
Bbsus   Csus

[Verse 2]
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

[Chorus 2]
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

[Break]

[Chorus 2]
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

[Outro]
