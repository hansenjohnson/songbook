[verse]
F                 Dm9
I, I'm I'm so in love with you
              Bb
Whatever you want to do
                  Bbm
Is all right with me
      Am  Gm       F   Em       D9             
Cause you make me feel so brand new
    Am  Gm      F   Em          D9
And I want to spend my life with you

[verse]
Let me say that since, baby, since we've been together
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me, be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

[chorus]
Bbmaj7            Am7
Let's, let's stay together (gether)
              Gm7
Lovin' you whether, whether
          Bbmaj7  Am    Dm7      C
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

[bridge]
Bbmaj7  Abmaj7  Bbmaj7  Abmaj7
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
                 Bbmaj7  Am    Dm7      C
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

[verse]
Why, why some people break up
Then turn around and make up
I just can't see
You'd never do that to me (would you, baby)
Staying around you is all I see
(Here's what I want us do)

[chorus]
Let's, we oughta stay together (gether)
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Come on
Let's stay, (let's stay together) let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether times are good or bad
