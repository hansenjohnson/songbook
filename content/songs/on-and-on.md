G - C - D (I IV V)

[Verse 1]
Traveling down this long lonesome highway
I'm so lonesome I could cry
With memories of how we once loved each other
And now you are saying good-bye

[Chorus]
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder where she can be
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me

[Verse 2]
I've cried I've cried for you little darling
It breaks my heart to hear your name
My friends they also love you my darling
And they think that I am to blame.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I have to follow you little darling
I can't sleep when the sun goes down
Cause by your side is my destination
The road is clear and that's where I'm bound.

[Chorus]
