Away you rolling river

Oh Shenandoah

I long to hear you
C              Am7
Away I'm bound away
           C    G      C     G
'Cross the wide Missouri

'Tis seven long years since I last saw you
Away, you rollin' river
'Tis seven long years since last I saw you
Away I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri.

Oh Shenandoah
I'm bound to leave you
Away you rolling river
Oh Shenandoah
I'll not deceive you
Away I'm bound away
'Cross the wide Missouri
