Capo 3

[Intro]
G D  G  A D

[Verse 1]
D                                   G
Wake up again in a old motel, is it somewhere different I can’t tell
A                     G                     D
Every set of curtains opens to the open road
                                    G
And I’m missing you like hell, this van is like a prison cell
    A                                 G               D
And I know you have gone with her and I can’t go back home

[Chorus]
                   Bm7        G D
I’ve been American dreaming, oooo
             Bm7        G D
I’m American dreaming, oooo
             Bm7        G
I’m American dreaming, ooo
             A            D
But, I never seem to get no rest

[Verse 2]
I should get some rest today then pack my bags, be on my way
But my minds always working on the way it could have been
Trying to tow a tight rope line, find a way to feel half fine
Without drowning in this wine, and calling you again

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
G D  G  A D

[Verse 3]
I’m losing touch with all my friends, the ones who remind me who I am
If I could just get back home to pick up where we left off
I’d take better care of myself, I’d stop drinking from the bottom shelf
But my old wheels keep spinning and I cannot make them stop

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
So, I get back home and try to be someone that’s something like me
But, I’ve forgotten all my angels out here in the wind
Sitting out here with my mind I meditate to pass the time
But there’s something inside setting sail all over again

[Interlude]
G D  G  A D

G D    G
Ooo, ooo
  A   D
Ooo, ooo

[Out-Chorus x2]
                   Bm7        G D
I’ve been American dreaming, oooo
             Bm7        G D
I’m American dreaming, oooo
             Bm7        G
I’m American dreaming, ooo
             A            D
But, I never seem to get no rest
