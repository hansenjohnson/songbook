G               C
Old man give me endless time
      G               C
Never let these ties sever
G                           C
It's breaking bottles in the yard
                    G
Never still my mind again
  C
Mmm

[Chorus]
D                 Em  C     D
Like old ties and companions
                    C
Just sitting on the fence

The tunes we've carried through the years will change
And man that's just enough
To keep these ghosts around those haunted fields
Mmm

[Chorus]
Like old ties and companions
You and I were just passing through

[Solo]

It's a hundred thousand miles of lonely track
Holding back tomorrow
Someday I'll hop along and ride it home

Like old ties and companions
We never leave alone

Old man give me endless time
Never let these ties sever
Heaven knows in all this foolin' 'round
These times won't last forever
After all
```
