C                   G/B         
Covered in gold, forgetting my skin
          F
I recall you, I recall when
Pulling your shirt up over your head
Laughing, gets stuck, gets stuck in bed

Am                  G
All that I do is a shadow of you
          F
And the light you make
I'm turning my face away from the shade
Swaying on cue, I'll be mimicking you
And the way you shake
You're a difficult love, I'm a narrow escape

Pulling my clothes, none of which fit
Bringing back us meeting as kids
Covered up red, I figured out fame
I honor your death making my name

With all of my guilt and the way that I'm built
I don't sleep so well
With all of that hope, the end of a rope
Swinging on cue, I'll be mimicking you
And the way you felt
When I know what you know, it's an easy let-go

G F
Oh I, I, I...

All that I do is a shadow of you
And the light you make
I'm turning my face away from the shade
Swaying on cue, I'll be mimicking you
And the way you shake
You're a difficult love, I'm a narrow escape

Covered in gold, forgetting my skin
I recall you, I recall when
