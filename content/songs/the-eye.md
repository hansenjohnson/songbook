[Intro]
F C F C F C G Am F C

[Verse]
F C                        F C                        
  It really breaks my heart, to see a dear old friend
F C  G           Am       F     C
  Go down in the worn out place again
F C                    F C                 
  Do you know the sound, of a closing door?
F C        G          Am        F       C     
  Have you heard that sound somewhere before?
F C        G          Am     F    C     G
  Do you wonder if she knows you anymore?

[Chorus]
F                                    C
I wrapped your love around me like a chain
F                                    G
But I never was afraid that it would die
C                  F  Am
You can dance in a hurricane
Am                          G      C
But only if you're standing in the eye

[Verse]
F C                         F  C                        
  Where did you learn to walk, where did you learn to run?
F C  G      Am   F         C
  Away from everything you love
F C                         F   C                        
  And did you think the bottle, would ever ease your pain?
F C        G         Am       F       C   
  Did you think that love's a foolish game?
F C        G         Am       F        C     G
  Did you find someone else to take the blame?

[Chorus]
F                                    C
I wrapped your love around me like a chain
F                                    G
But I never was afraid that it would die
C                  F  Am
You can dance in a hurricane
Am                          G      C
But only if you're standing in the eye

[Post-Chorus]
C                  F      Am
You can dance in a hurricane
Am                          G      C
But only if you're standing in the eye

[Intro / Break]
F C F C F C G Am F C

[Verse]

F C                F  C                        
  I am a sturdy soul, and there ain't no shame
F C  G      Am         F       C    
In lying down in the bed you made
F   C          G      Am      F        C     G
Can you fight the urge to run for another day?
                  Am    G                 C
You might make it further if you learn to stay

[Chorus]
F                                    C
I wrapped your love around me like a chain
F                                    G
But I never was afraid that it would die
C                  F  Am
You can dance in a hurricane
Am                               G
But only if you're standing in the eye

[Outro]
C                   F      Am
You can dance in a hurricane
Am                  G               C
But only if you're standing in the eye
