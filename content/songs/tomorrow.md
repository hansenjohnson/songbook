G
Well I'm tired of losing
            C                    G  G/F#
I used to win every night of the week
           Em
Yeah, and back when sex and amphetamines
            C                        G
Oh were the staples of our childhood physique
            G                       
You used to tell me we'd turn into something
             C                          G
Oh, you said life was much better than this
              Em
Yeah, but the closest I've come to perfection
            C                        G
Is when you turned around to steal a kiss

        Em
But you never trusted tomorrow
              C                        G  
Yeah, baby is that anyway to live your life?
      Em            
Well, you love this heart and this six string, girl, oh
    C                                      G
But they've been outta tune yeah for some time

[Instrumental]
Oooh
G C G // Em C G // G C G // Em C

                G
Well, you said, "Oh, I love so many women
                    C                           G
Oh there's so many women, lord it's driving me wild"
            Em
Yeah, they say you get lost in complexion
        C                           G
And the structure of a well-placed smile

[Bridge]
             G   Em                            
But luckily you (ooh)
                C
Oh, you never smile
        Em
Yeah, oh you, ooh 
          C
you never smile
          C            D7                       
Oh and it looks just a little bit better that way to me
             C7     D7
Sometimes it does

                        Em
Oh but, you know, you never trusted tomorrow
            C                       G
Oh, baby, that's just a problem of mine
            Em
Yeah, I've been thrown around by some bad ones, girl
            C                           G
Oh, and a good one was a new thing this time

                G
Yeah, but you showed me that I couldn't be farther
             C                       G
Oh, from the truth of the problem at hand
    Em
Oh, I could never say "Baby, tomorrow
         C                             
Oh, I'll be right there, I'ma be your man, 

G   C   G   Em  C
