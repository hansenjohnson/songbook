C             Em
Turn down the lights
Em              C
Turn down the bed
C                G/B     Em        Am
Turn down these voices inside my head
C             Em
Lay down with me
Em            C
Tell me no lies
C              G/B   Em    Am
Just hold me close, don't patronize
        D
Don't patronize me

                C             G           C
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
            C         G          G/B        C
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
  Em          C       D/F#        Em
Here in the dark, in these final hours
        Em          C         D/F#          Em
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
        Am            D
But you won't, no you won't
                C         G              C
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't

C Em Em C C G/B Am

I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me till then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't
```
