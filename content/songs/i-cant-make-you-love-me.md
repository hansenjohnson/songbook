G Bm Bm G G A/F# Em

[Verse 1]
G             Bm
Turn down the lights
Bm              G
Turn down the bed
G                A/F#     Bm        Em
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
        A
Don't patronize

[Chorus]
                G             D           G
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
            G         D          A/F#        G
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
  Bm          G       D/F#        Em
Here in the dark, in these final hours
        Bm          G         A/F#          G
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
        Em            A
But you won't, no you won't
                G         D              G
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't

[Interlude]
G Bm Bm G G A/F# Em

[Verse 2]
I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me till then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

[Chorus]
