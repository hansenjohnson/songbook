D riff

Em7
Come a little bit closer
                    D Dmaj7 A Asus
Hear what I have to say
Em7
Just like children sleeping
                            D riff
We could dream this night away
G
But there's a full moon rising
                          D Dmaj7 A Asus
Let's go dancing in the light
G
We know where the music's playing
                           D riff
Let's go out and feel the night

[Chorus]
A                               A7
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon

D riff (x2)

When we were strangers
I watched you from afar
When we were lovers
I loved you with all my heart
But now it's getting late
And the moon is climbing high
I want to celebrate
See it shining in your eye

[Chorus]

[Solo over verse]

[Chorus]

On this harvest moon
On this harvest moon...
