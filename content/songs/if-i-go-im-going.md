C F C Am F C

This house
      F       C
She’s holding secrets
  F      Am     F          C
I got my change behind the bed

In a coffee can
I throw my nickels in
Just in case I have to leave

           F         C
And I will go if you ask me to
       F           G
I will stay if you dare
         C       C/B   Am
And if I go, I’m goin' shameless
            F              C
I’ll let my hunger take me there

This house
She’s quite the talker
She creaks and moans
She keeps me up

And the photographs
Know I’m a liar
They just laugh as I burn her down

And I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
And if I go, I’m goin' on fire
Let my anger take me there

    G
The shingles, man, they’re shaking
    C                   F
The back door’s burning through
         C           C/B       Am
This old house she’s quite the keeper
          F         C
Quite the keeper of you

I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
And if I go, I’m goin' crazy
I’ll let my darlin' take me there

If I go, I'm goin' crazy
Let my darlin' take me there
