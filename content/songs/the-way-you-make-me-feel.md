Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever
Like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk,
Your talk, your dress
I feel your fever
From miles around
I'll pick you up in my car
And we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby
And tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone

I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy
Oh I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone,

Go on girl!
Go on! Hee! Hee! Aaow!
Go on girl!
I never felt so in love before
Promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone

Ain't nobody's business,
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business,
Ain't nobody's business but
Mine and my baby

Give it to me, give me some time
Come on be my girl, I want to
Be with mine
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business but
Mine and my baby's
Go on girl! Aaow!
Hee hee! Aaow!
Chika, chika
Chika, chika, chika
Go on girl!, Hee hee!
Hee hee hee!
