Am7        Dm7
Times are hard
        G7                 Cmaj7
You're afraid to pay the fee
       F                 Bb
So you find yourself somebody
        C              G/B  Am7  G
Who can do the job for free
Fmaj7    Am7            Dm7
When you need a bit of lovin'
           G             Cmaj7
Cause your man is out of town
           F               Bb
That's the time you get me runnin'
        C             Dm
And you know I'll be around
 

C      Fmaj7            Am7
 I'm a fool to do your dirty work
   Bb     B
Oh yeah
C        Fmaj7          Am7
 I don't wanna do your dirty work
   Bb     B
No more
C      F               Am7
 I'm a fool to do your dirty work
   Bb         C   F
Oh yeah

Light the candle
Put the lock upon the door
You have sent the maid home early
Like a thousand times before
Like the castle in its corner
In a medieval game
I foresee terrible trouble
And I stay here just the same
 
 I'm a fool to do your dirty work
Oh yeah
 I don't wanna do your dirty work
No more
 I'm a fool to do your dirty work
Oh yeah

 I'm a fool to do your dirty work
Oh yeah
 I don't wanna do your dirty work
No more
 I'm a fool to do your dirty work
Oh yeah
