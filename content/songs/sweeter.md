Em Em/F# G  (x2)
C  C/B   Am (x2)

[Chorus]

Em           Em/F#     G
Hoping for a life more sweeter
Em                 Em/F#  G
Instead I'm just a story repeating
C        C/B       Am
Why do I fear with skin dark as night?
C          C/B        Am
Can't feel peace with those judging eyes

Em           Em/F#     G
I thought we moved on from the darker days. Did the words of the 
Em           Em/F#     G
King disappear in the air, like a butterfly?
Em               Em/F#     G
Somebody should hand you a felony
             C    C/B  Am
Because you stole from me, my chance to be

[Chorus]

    Em        Em/F#    G    G#dim Am
The tears of my Mother rain rain over me
My sisters and my brothers sing sing over me
And I wish I had another day, but it's just another day

[Chorus]
