Bring in the kids (clap clap clap clap)
E
Put out the cat (clap clap clap clap)
E                                       B7
Here comes that ol' man, roly poly and fat
               E                   A
It's time for fun, it's time for cheer
             E              B7          A           B7    E
It's time to get together again, cause it's that time of year

    A               E
For another Hansen Christmas
  A                             E
Started by Nany and Poppy long ago
  A                      E  Dbm7
Look around this is your family
Gb7                                   B7
Shining with that good ol' Christmas glow

E
We're gonna dance (clap clap clap clap)
E
Sing a few tunes (clap clap clap clap)
E                                                           B7
We're gonna go swing on a star and laugh at the man in the moon
            E               A
This is a day, of peace and love
             E              B7          A           B7    E
A day to get together with friends, and thank the lord above

E
When it's time to go (clap clap clap clap)
E
We may shed a tear (clap clap clap clap)
E                                                    B7
It's hard to leave some folks who we won't see for a year
            E                   A
But in a while, we'll be back here
      E              B7          E                B7 
For another Hansen Christmas, it's the spirit of Moriches
             A              B7             E   A  EAE        
It's that Hansen family Christmas time of year
