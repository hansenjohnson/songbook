Put out the cat (clap clap clap clap)

Here comes that ol' man, roly poly and fat
               G                   C
It's time for fun, it's time for cheer
             G              D7          C           D7    G
It's time to get together again, cause it's that time of year

    C               G
For another Hansen Christmas
  C                             G
Started by Nany and Poppy long ago
  C                      G  Em
Look around this is your family
A7                                   D7
Shining with that good ol' Christmas glow

G
We're gonna dance (clap clap clap clap)
G
Sing a few tunes (clap clap clap clap)
G                                                           D7
We're gonna go swing on a star and laugh at the man in the moon
            G               C
This is a day, of peace and love
             G              D7          C           D7    G
A day to get together with friends, and thank the lord above

When it's time to go (clap clap clap clap)

We may shed a tear (clap clap clap clap)
G                                                    D7
It's hard to leave some folks who we won't see for a year
            G                   C
But in a while, we'll be back here
      G              D7          G                D7 
For another Hansen Christmas, it's the spirit of Moriches

It's that Hansen family Christmas time of year
