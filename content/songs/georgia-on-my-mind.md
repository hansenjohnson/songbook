G        B7      Em7  G7          C       C#o
Georgia, Georgia,  the whole day through
        G         Em     A7 D7                  G C G D7
Just an old sweet song   keeps Georgia on my mind
G        B7      Em7  G7          C       C#o
Georgia,  Georgia,    a song of you
        G         Em     A7 D7                  G C G B7
Comes sweet and clear  as moonlight through the pines

Em7   Em7/D# Em7/D    Em7/C#
Other arms  reach out to me
Em7   Em7/D# Em7/D    Em7/C#
Other eyes smile tenderly
Em7         C       G        F#7       Bm7        G#o    Am7  D9
Still in peaceful dreams I see   the road leads back to you


I said Georgia
Ooh Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Whoa, Georgia, Georgia
No peace, no peace I find
Just this old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
I said just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
