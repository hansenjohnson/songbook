C                                                     		G
Rocking around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop
G                                                       C
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop
C                                                       		  G
Rocking around the Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring
G                                       	          	C
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling

F                          Em
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Am                              D                   G
Voices singing let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly
C                                                   G
Rocking around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday
G                                                 C
Everyone dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way
