Capo 2 D - G - A (I VI V)

[Verse 1]
Every time it rains, Lord, I run to my window
All I do is just wring my hands and moan
And listen to that thunder, Lord
Can't you hear that lonesome wind moan?
Tell me, baby, now why you been gone so long?

[Chorus]
Tell me, baby, now why you been gone so long
You been gone so long now
Tell me, baby, now why you been gone so long
A wolf is scratchin' at my door, Lord, Lord
And I can hear that lonesome wind moan
Tell me, baby, now why you been gone so long

[Verse 2]
Somebody said they thought they saw you roarin' down in Reno
With a big ol' man from San Anton
They tell me I'm a fool, I pine for you, but what do they know?
Tell me, baby, now why you been gone so long

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Nothin' I gotta do, so I guess I'll go get stoned
And let the past paint pictures in my head
Drink a fifth of thunderbird and try to write a sad, sad song
Tell me, baby, now why you been gone so long

[Chorus]
