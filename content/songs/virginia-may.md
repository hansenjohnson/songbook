[Intro]
C   F   G

[Verse 1]

C
Slept high up in the Rockies
         F            G                C   F   C
set my clock for californ-i-ey-aye.
       Em
And I dreamed up somethin' special
             F              G            C   F   C
to give that ocean man, she cuffs me anyway.

       C
So I’m banking on Virginia
   F                G          C        F   C
to keep me calm and clear and straight.
          Em
Just like clock work seems to tell us
           F                     G             C     F   C
with every passing storm there’s just a harder hail.

[Chorus]
     F        C    F        Am
So I light my way, Virginia May
     C                                   G
I can’t sit still, just pace across this hallway.
          F       C
We spent all this time
       F     Am
just trading crimes,
            G
while the tune-smith packed a lunch,
          F                 C  F   C
he’s headed down the coastline.

C   F   G     C  F  C

[Verse 2]
           C
There’s a loneliness thats blowin'
       F                 G     C      F   C
well I heard it from the radio man.
          Em
He’s been locked up in the belfry
          F           G            C     F   C
listening close to a string upon a can.

        C
Me, I’m sailin on to that savior,
         F             G              C      F   C
she’s a pilgrim living on the modern time.
         Em
And ever since I found her magic
           F                G            C     F   C
now every car or cloud that passes is a sign.

[Chorus]
     F        C    F        Am
So I light my way, Virginia May
     C                                   G
I can’t sit still, just pace across this hallway.
          F       C
We spent all this time
       F     Am
just trading crimes,

[Outro]
         G                   F           C
and I’m saving all my sleep for another life
         G                   F           C
and I’m saving all my sleep for another life
     G                   F           C
I’m saving all my sleep for another life
