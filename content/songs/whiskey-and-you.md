Dsus riff
There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
Bmin7
And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
Dsus riff
I'll be hurting when I wake up on the floor
           Bmin7  Asus  G  
But I'll be over it by noon
            D                   A          D
That's the difference between whiskey and you

Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, that's something I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference between whiskey and you

          A                  G
One's the devil, one keeps driving me insane
          A                  G
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
            Dsus riff             
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
              Bmin7      Asus    G
And one's the long gone bitter truth
            D                 A           D
That's the difference between whiskey and you

I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference between whiskey and you

One's the devil, one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder, oh if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you
Ah, that's the difference between whiskey and you
