Baby, baby, baby
I'm coming home
To your tender sweet loving
You're my one and only woman
The world leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, girl
You're the only one that I want
I wanna be around

[Chorus]

F# C# B
I wanna be around you girl
I wanna be around girl
I wanna be around

Baby, how I'd be grieving
If you wanted to leave me all alone now
By myself, I don't want nobody else
The world leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, girl
You're the only one that I want
I wanna be around

[Chorus]

Baby, baby, baby
I'm coming home
To your tender sweet loving
You're my one and only woman
The world leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, girl
You're the only one that I want
I wanna be around

[Chorus]

F# C# B
I need you baby
Girl I, I need your loving
Darling, wanna hold you close
Girl, girl
