        G
Oh, the weather outside is frightful,
        D
But the fire is so delightful,
    Am             E7       Am
And since we've no place to go,
       D7           Bm           G
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.


   G
It doesn't show signs of stopping,
      D
And I brought some corn for popping.
    Am                E7       Am
The lights are turned way down low,
       D7           Bm           G
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow


        D
When we finally kiss good night,
         Em         A7         D
How I'll hate going out in the storm.
       D
But if you really hold me tight,
E7          A7           D
All the way home I'll be warm.


    G
The fire is slowly dying,
        D
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing,
       Am          E7      Am
But as long as you love me so.
       D7           Am           G
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
