[Verse 1]
Am
Never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham if it hadn't been for love
                                                      F
Never woulda caught the train to Louisian' if it hadn't been for love
Am
Never woulda run through the blindin' rain
F
without one dollar to my name
F                           E              Am
if it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

[Verse 2]
Never woulda seen the trouble that i'm in if it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind if it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
if it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

[Chorus]
C               Dm        C
Four cold walls against my will
C                     Dm    Am
at least I know she's lying still
C                Dm      C
Four cold walls without parole
C              Dm     Am
Lord have mercy on my soul

[Verse 3]
Never woulda gone to that side of town if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda took a mind to track her down if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda loaded up a forty four
put myself behind a jail house door
if it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda caught the train to Louisian' if it hadn't been for love .
Never woulda loaded up a forty four
put myself behind a jail house door
if it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love (x3)
