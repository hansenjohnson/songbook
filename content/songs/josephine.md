Capo 8th fret

[Chorus]
        Am   G   C             F        F/C  G
Take me back Josephine to that cold and dark December.
     Am      G       C     F          G
I am missing someone but I don’t know who.
        Am  G     C            F      F/C   G
Now I’m standing alone and I’m trying to remember
    Am      G      C     F    G              C   Csus4 C
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you

[Verse 1]
F        C            G
Noontime wind can you blow
       Am       Am/E     F
For me one more time and take me
   C           G
On back to the start
F                  C              G
Where the midnight moon shines so bright
        Am       Am/E  F
Nearly pulled us up to heaven
       C              G
By the strings of our hearts

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
F       C            G
Morning sun shine on me
     Am      Am/E    F
Come light inside my window
    C          G
And rest on my brow
F       C           G
Kiss my eyes when I sleep
    Am    Am/E    F
And carry me back home
      C           G
If my dreams will allow

[Chorus x2]

Am      G       C    F         G                    C
Someone help me understand why I’m still loving you
