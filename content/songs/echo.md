Capo 3


```
G
Well I try to close my eyes, clear my mind
    Em                         G
Just listen to the wildflowers grow
     D        
Such whispers on the breeze
G                  C
It don't come easy now
C
Over all this noise

Em                       G
Spent my youth among the pine
C                           D
They used to sing a tune so fine
        Em     D            C
And the wind moved like an echo
D              G
Carryin' their voices

G
And I saw it in a dream, monuments to trees
        Em                                G
As the air we breathe turned our lungs to dust
        D
And the redwoods so tall
    G
And all their awe
C
Began to rust

Em                       G
With no bend and sway at all
C                     D
That ancient dance was lost
        Em                 C
And the wind moved like an echo
D            G
Beside every gust

Bm
Well some day I hope to find
     C
That land of funny wine
          G                      D
Where the coffee grows on the white oak trees
        Am
And those sugar coated mountains
        
In the spring begin to melt into

Sweetest streams
Where each night the starlight and the sea
Together form eternity
And the wind moves like an echo
As the world drops off to sleep
