G
Well I try to close my eyes, clear my mind
    Em                         G
Just listen to the wildflowers grow
     D        
Such whispers on the breeze
G                  C
It don't come easy now
C
Over all this noise

Em                       G
Spent my youth among the pine
C                           D
They used to sing a tune so fine
        Em     D            C
And the wind moved like an echo
D              G
Carryin' their voices

G
And I saw it in a dream, monuments to trees
        Em                                G
As the air we breathe turned our lungs to dust
        D
And the redwoods so tall
    G
And all their awe
C
Began to rust

Em                       G
With no bend and sway at all
C                     D
That ancient dance was lost
        Em     D           C
And the wind moved like an echo
D            G
Beside every gust

Bm
Well some day I hope to find
     C
That land of funny wine
          G                      D
Where the coffee grows on the white oak trees
        Am
And those sugar coated mountains
        G                   C
In the spring begin to melt into

C                   Em
Sweetest dreams
Em                                      G       
Where each night the starlight and the sea
C             D
Together form eternity
        Em   D             C
And the wind moves like an echo
        D                 G
As the world drops off to sleep
