Chorus
   C              G
   Get down boys, go back home
   D                    G
   Back to the girl you love
   C                G
   Treat her right, never wrong
   D                      G
   How mountain girls can love

G
Riding the night in the high cold winds
       D                         G
On the trail of the old lonesome pine
G 
Thinking of you, feeling so blue
          D               G
Wondering why you left me behind

Chorus

Solo

Remember the night we strolled down the lane
Our hearts were gay and happy then
You whispered to me as I held your close
You hoped this night would never end

Chorus
