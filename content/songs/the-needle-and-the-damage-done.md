 D                            D/C
I caught you knockin' at my cellar door
D/B                       D/Bb
"I love you, baby. Can I have some more?"
C     F             Esus4    E
Ooh, ooh, the damage done

I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done

[Repeat Intro]

I sing the song, because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Milk-blood to keep from running out

I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's like a settin' sun
```
