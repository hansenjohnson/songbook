C   F (x4)

C          F     C     F    C                 F  
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
C      F     C       F      C                   F
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
F      Em7      Am       D/F#     F        E7    Am     G
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
C             F       C          F   C                 G   F Em Dm
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street, handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs, the boulevard is not that bad
Piano man he makes his stand in the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs the words she knows the tune she hums

Ab            Bb
But oh how it feels so real
Gm              Cm
Lying here with no one near
Ab                  Bb
Only you and you can hear me
        Bdim        G
When I say softly slowly

[Chorus]
F       C      Dm            Em F
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

[Chorus]

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
