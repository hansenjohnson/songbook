[Verse 1]
A              C#m
I can feel her heartbeat
D               A
from a thousand miles
A               C#min
And the heavens open
D              A
every time she smiles
A                  C#m
And when I come to her
D              A
that's where I belong
A                 C#min
Yeah, I'm running to her
D              A
like a river's song
 
[Chorus]
               A   G#m  F#m   E    D     A
She gives me love love love  love, crazy love
               A   G#m  F#m   E    D     A
She gives me love love love  love, crazy love
 
[Verse 2]
She's got a fine sense of humor 
when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her
when the sun goes down
take away my trouble 
take away my grief
Take away my heartache, 
in the night like a thief 
 
[Chorus]
She gives me love love love  love, crazy love
She gives me love love love  love, crazy love
 
[Bridge]
  E     D              A
Yes I need her in the daytime
  E     D              A
Yes I need her in the night
  E   D                 A           C#m
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
  E                D                A    E
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight
 
[Verse 3]
And when I'm returning 
from so far away
She gives me some sweet 
lovin brightens up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, 
yes it makes me whole
Yes it makes me mellow down 
into my soul
 
[Chorus] (x2)
She gives me love love love  love, crazy love
She gives me love love love  love, crazy love
