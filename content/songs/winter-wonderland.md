             D
Sleigh bells ring are you listening
       A
In the lane snow is glistening
  A7        Em            A      A7
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Bm           A            D
Walking in a Winter Wonderland


     D
Gone away is the blue bird
       A
In his place is the new bird
    A7          Em         A   A7
Hes singing our song as we go along
Bm           A            D
Walking in a Winter Wonderland


F#            B              F#
In the meadow we can build a snowman
F#                B            F#
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
A                  D                A
He'll say Are you married We'll say No man
    A7             E                  A
But you can do the job when you're in town


      D
Later on we'll conspire
      A
As we dream by the fire
   A7      Em        A             A7
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Bm           A            D
Walking in a Winter Wonderland


F#            B              F#
In the meadow we can build a snowman
F#                B            F#
Then pretend that he's a circus clown
A                  D                A
We'll have lot's of fun with mister snowman
    A7             E             A
Until the other kids knock him down


      D
When it snows, ain't in thrilling
      A
Though your nose get's a chilling
         A7      Em        A       A7
We'll frolic and play, the eskimo way
Bm           A            D
Walking in a Winter Wonderland
Bm           A            D
Walking in a Winter Wonderland
Bm           A            D    G DGD
Walking in a Winter Wonderland
