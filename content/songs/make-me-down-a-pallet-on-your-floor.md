F                             C
Make me down a pallet on your floor
F                             C
Make me down a pallet on your floor
E7             F            
Make me down a pallet soft and low
C                   G               C
When I'm broke an' I got no where to go

Been hangin' around with a good time friends of mine
Hangin' around with a good time friends of mine
Oh, they treat me very nice and kind
When I've got a dollar and a dime

Weary blues everywhere I see
Weary in blues everywhere I see
Weary blues, honey, everywhere I see
No one ever had the blues like me

Way I'm sleepin', my back and shoulders tired
Way I'm sleepin', my back and shoulders tired
Come tomorrow, I'll be satisfied
If I can catch that fast train and ride

So, make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet soft and low
Babe, I'm broke and I got no where to go
