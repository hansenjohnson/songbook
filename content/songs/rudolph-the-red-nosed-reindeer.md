         F         Em         Dm           C
You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
F         Em        Dm          C
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
Am           Dm
But do you recall
         D7                 G7
The most famous reindeer of all?


C
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
                 G
Had a very shiny nose
G
And if you ever saw it
                      C
You would even say it glows
C
All of the other reindeer
                           G
Used to laugh and call him names
G
They never let poor Rudolph
                     C
Join in any reindeer games


F              Em
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Dm7   G       C
Santa came to say:
G
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
D7                 G7
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
C
Then how the reindeer loved him.
                         G
As they shouted out with glee:
G
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
                  C
You'll go down in history"
