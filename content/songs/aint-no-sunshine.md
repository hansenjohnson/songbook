Am7 Em G Am7

Am7                               Em G Am7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Am7                               Em G Am7
It's not warm when she's away
Am7                            Em7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                          Dm7
And she's always gone too long
                    Am7 Em G Am7
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know (repeat...)
Hey, I oughtta leave young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away (x4)

```
