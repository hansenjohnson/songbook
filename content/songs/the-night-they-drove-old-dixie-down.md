Am      C/G                     F             Em      Dm
Virgil Caine is the name and I served on the Danville train
Am              C/G              F           Em      Dm
'Til Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
C                 F           C/G           Dm
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
C                 F
By May the tenth, Richmond had fell
C/G           Dm              D
It's a time I remember, oh so well

[Chorus]
C/G             F               C/G           F
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing
C/G             F               C/G           F
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the people were singing
            C/G         Am          G          F              C
They went, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
"Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E.Lee"
Now I don't mind choppin' wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

[Chorus]

Like my father before me, I will work the land
And like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat

[Chorus]
