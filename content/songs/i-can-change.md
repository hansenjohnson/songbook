F             C
Hate casts a long shadow
G           Am         G
I know that I lie in it
F                   C                 G
And let it rule my mind from time to time
Escapin' an old battle
That clings on like a vine to me
Whispers dirty lies in my ear

          C                 F
I know we didn't start this fight
          C                 E7   F        
And I won't let it rule my heart tonight

F     C
I can change
G     Am
I can change
F   C       G
I can still change

Tracin' an old pattern
Drawing the lines from where I am and from where I wanna be
Forget that old adage
That history continues to keep us from a world we wanna see

I am scared that I won't get it right
But fear won't rule my heart tonight

I can change
I can change
I can still change
I can still change

I can change
I can change
I can still change
I can still change
```
