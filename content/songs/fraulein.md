Capo 4 for duet
G C D

[Verse 1]

Far across the deep blue water
Lives an old German's daughter
On the banks of the old river Rhine

There I loved her and left her
Now, I can't forget her
She was my pretty fraulein

[Chorus]

Fraulein, fraulein look up toward the Heavens
Each night when them stars start to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty fraulein

[Verse 2]

When my memories wander 
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind

In a moment of glory
Her face comes before me
The face of my pretty fraulein

[Chorus]

You are my pretty fraulein
