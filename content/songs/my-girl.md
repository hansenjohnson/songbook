          C             F
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
          C                         F
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
    C   Dm    F    G
Well I guess you'd say
    C    Dm      F         G
What can make me feel this way?
    C   
My girl (my girl, my girl)
              F         G
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl ooh)

C  F
   Hey hey hey
C  F
   Hey hey hey
Dm   G   Em   A A A
Ooh yeah

        D                          G
I don't need no money, fortune, or fame (ooh hey hey hey)
        D                          G
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim (oh yes I do)
D Em    G     A  
I guess you'd say
D         Em     G         A
What can make me feel this way?
D
My girl
              G       A
Talkin' 'bout my girl

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
She's all I can think
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout my girl
