[Intro]
C   Am7   C   Am7   C   Am7   C   Am7


[Verse 1]
C             Am7          C     Am7
Come away with me   in the night
C            Am7                Em     F        C     G
Come away with me and I will   write   you a song
 
[Verse 2]
Come away with me on a bus
Come away where they can't tempt us with their lies
 
[Chorus 1]
G             F         C
  And I wanna walk with you     On a cloudy day
G                     F                   C
  In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
            G           C
So won't you   try   to come
 
[Verse 3]
Come away  with me and we'll kiss   On a mountaintop
Come away  with me And I'll    never stop   loving you
 
[Instrumental]
C    Am7    C    Am7    C    Am7    Em7    Fsus2    C   G
C    Am7    C    Am7    C    Am7    Em7    Fsus2    C
 
[Chorus 2]
G               F                  C
  And I want to wake up   with the rain  falling on a tin roof
G           F                     C
  While I'm safe there  in your arms
         G            C
So all I   ask is for you
 
[Outro]
             Am7                 C   Am7
to come away with me  in the night
C            G            C
    Come away      with me
