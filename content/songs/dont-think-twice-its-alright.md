Capo 4

[Verse 1]
   C               G              Am       Am/G
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
F                       C   G
 If'n you don't know by now
       C               G              Am       Am/G
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
D7/F#               G    G7
It'll never do somehow
          C                    C7
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
F                         D7/F#
 Look out your window and I'll be gone
C          G          Am        F
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
C           G               C
Don't think twice, it's all right
 
[Verse 2]
And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
 I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
Don't think twice, it's all right
 
[Verse 3]
No, it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
 Like you never did before
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
 I can't hear you anymore
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's all right
 
[Verse 4]
So loooooong, honey babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
 So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right
