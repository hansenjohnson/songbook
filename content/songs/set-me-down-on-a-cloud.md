     C           G
I'm sitting in a room
     C           G
And waiting for an answer
                    D                       G    
And hoping that the lord sees fit to let me leave
'Cause if the news ain't good
And you ain't comin' back here
I'm gonna stay until my bones have turned to leaves

                 C
I'm waiting on a word
             G
Hanging on a prayer
G
White walls like limbo
G                        D           
They keep my feet on the ground
             G
If I lose my baby
    C                      G
I tell you where they can lay me
G
Set me down on a cloud
        D                  G
With my soul turned inside out

Well they fixed me up good
But my heart's still bleeding
And there's only one thing in this world to let me heal
Baby open up your eyes and tell me you're not leavin'
And I'm gonna make you feel so good it won't feel real

I'm waiting on a word
Hanging on a prayer
White walls like limbo
They keep my feet on the ground
If I lose my baby
I tell you where they can lay me
Set me down on a cloud
With my soul turned inside out
(x2)
