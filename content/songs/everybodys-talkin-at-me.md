Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

People stoppin' starin'
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes

Banking off of the North east winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

I'm going where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes

Banking off of the North east winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talkin' at me
Can't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

I won't let you leave my love behind
No I won't let you leave
I won't let you leave my love behind
```
