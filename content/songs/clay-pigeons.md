Capo 3
G C/G G D7/F# (repeat)

I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station
Gonna buy a ticket to ride
I'm gonna find that lady with two or three kids
And sit down by her side
Ride till the sun comes up and down
Around about two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Sing this song for the people I meet
And get along with it all
Where the people say "y'all"
Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in
And get back in the game
And start playin' again

I'd like to stay, but I might have to go to start over again
I might go back down to Texas
Or go to somewhere that I've never been
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't have to go home
Get used to being alone
Change the words to this song
And start singin' again

I'm tired of runnin' round lookin' for answers
To questions that I already know
I could build me a castle with memories
Just to have somewhere to go
Count the days and the nights
That it takes to get back in the saddle again
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
And start talkin' again
When I know what to say

I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station
Gonna buy a ticket to ride
I'm gonna find that lady with two or three kids
And sit down by her side
Ride till the sun comes up and down
Around about two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Sing my song for the people I meet
And get along with it all
Where the people say "y'all"
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
And start talkin' again
When I know what to say
