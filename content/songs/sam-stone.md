Capo 3

[Verse 1]
    D
Sam Stone came home,
       G
to his wife and family,
      A                           D
after serving in the conflict overseas.

And the time that he served,
    G
had shattered all his nerves,
    A                             D
and left a little shrapnel in his knee. 
        G
But the morphine eased the pain,

and the grass grew round his brain,
    E7                             A
and gave him all the confidence he lacked;
       E                  E7            A
with a Purple Heart and a monkey on his back.

[Chorus]
          D                                 Em
There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,
    G                                  A
and Jesus Christ died for nothin' I suppose.
       D
Little pitchers have big ears,
      Bm
don't stop to count the years,
      E7                   E                  A   A Asus4 A A
sweet songs never last too long on broken radios. Mmm....

[Verse 2]
Sam Stone's welcome home
Didn't last too long
He went to work when he'd spent his last dime
And Sammy took to stealing
When he got that empty feeling
For a hundred dollar habit without overtime
And the gold rolled through his veins
Like a thousand railroad trains
And eased his mind in the hours that he chose
While the kids ran around wearin' other peoples' clothes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sam Stone was alone
When he popped his last balloon
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair
Well, he played his last request
While the room smelled just like death
With an overdose hovering in the air
But life had lost its fun
There was nothing to be done
But trade his house that he bought on the GI bill
For a flag-draped casket on a local hero's hill

[Chorus]
