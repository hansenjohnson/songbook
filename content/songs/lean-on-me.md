C                 F                 C
Sometimes in our lives we all have pain
C           Am  G
We all have sorrow
C               F
But if we are wise
F               C             G/B  C
We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show

[C funk]
So just call on me brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

So just call on me brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on

If there is a load you have to bear
That you can't carry
I'm right up the road
I'll share your load
If you just call me

Call me, if you need a friend
Call me, oh baby now
Call me, if you need a friend
Call me ... yeah ever need me
Call me, call me
Call me, call me
Call me, call me
Call me, call me
```
