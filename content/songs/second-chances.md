Capo 2 with open E

D
all of my heroes sit up straight
     G            D           G     D
they stare at the ground they radiate

me, I’m mumbling in the kitchen for the sun to pay up
lonely is a ring on a cold coffee cup

    G         D         
I’m some sick hound
G           Bm7
digging for bones
      A                               G       D
if it weren’t for second chances, we’d all be alone

my hands they were strangers lost in the night
they’re waving around in the dusty light

I’m waiting in the wings while the trees undress
cupping my ear to hear the wind confess

I’m a ghost in the garden
scaring the crows
if it weren’t for second chances, we’d all be alone

    A                        G              D
I’m running from nothing, no thoughts in my mind
      Bm7             
oh my heart was all black
      G             D
but I saw something shine

thought that part was yours, but it might just be mine
I could share it with you
if you gave me the time

    G         D       
I’m all bloody knuckles,
G           Bm7
longing for home
      A                               G       D
if it weren’t for second chances, we’d all be alone

I’m a shot through the dark
I’m a black sinkhole
if it weren’t for second chances, we’d all be alone
