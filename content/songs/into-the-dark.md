[Verse]
C/G
Love of mine
        Am/E
someday you will die,
            F
but I'll be close behind;
             C            G
I'll follow you into the dark.
   C/G
No blinding light
              Am/E
or tunnels to gates of white,
               F
just our hands clasped so tight
         C                  G
waiting for the hint of a spark. 
 
[Chorus]
     Am               C              F             C    G/B
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,
  Am           C              G
illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs.
     Am              C                 E      Am     Am/G
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
     F           Fm           C/G
then I'll follow you into the dark.
 
[Verse]
In Catholic school,              
as vicious as Roman rule,
I got my knuckles bruised 
by a lady in black.
And I held my tongue 
as she told me "Son, 
fear is the heart of love".
So I never went back.
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse]
You and me
have seen everything to see
from Bangkok to Calgary, 
and the soles of your shoes
are all worn down.
The time for sleep is now
but it's nothing to cry about               
'cause we'll hold each other soon
in the blackest of rooms.
 
[Chorus]
