[Chorus]
D
Beautiful flowers in the morning dew
                        A
They're nothing without you
    G          A       Bm                        A
You flutter on by in a flash of color and you're gone
       A
But we keep on rolling on

[Verse 1]
In eighteen hundred and eighty-five when
A man by the name of Benz
Put three wheels together and an engine, too
He had no idea it could be the death of you
But we keep on rolling on

*Bass riff - D A G A Bm A*

[Verse 2]
I like to head out and arrive real soon
Kind of doze off in between
A little splash here, a tiny bump there
I clean off the window and I see real clear again
And I keep on rolling on

[Chorus]

*Bass riff - D A G A Bm A*

[Verse 3]
Well, the summertime blues are burning red hot
Red hotter than they've ever been
But if the whole world screamed at the top of their lungs
It wouldn't make a sound on the moon, much less the sun
But we keep on rolling on

[Chorus]

*Bass riff - D A G A Bm A*

[Verse 4]
Big Oil's got the money and the money goes 'round
Lord, we don't know where it ends
And the more I see the less I know which way we're all gonna go from here
We keep on rolling on
