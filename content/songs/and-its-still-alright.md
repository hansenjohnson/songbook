Capo 2

C riff

[Verse 1]
C        Am             F           C
It ain't alright, the hardness of my head
C               Am       F  
Now close your eyes and spin around
      G     C        G     C
Say, hard times, you could find
        G         C            F           
That it ain't the way that you want
                C
But it's still alright

[Verse 2]

Late at night, do you lay around wondering?
Counting all the lines, it ain't so funny now
Say, times are hard, you get this far
But it ain't the way that you want
G       C           G      C
I'll be damned if this old man
        G           C       F
Don't start to counting his losses
                C
But it's still alright

[Bridge]
G
They say you learn a lot out there
C
How to scorch and burn
G
Gonna have to bury your friends
C
And then you'll find it gets worse
G
Standing out on the ledge
C
With no way to get down
G                           F
Start praying for wings to grow
                   C
Oh, baby, just let go

[Verse 3]

I ain't alright, you keep spinning out ahead
It was cold outside when I hit the ground
Say, I could sleep here, forget all the fear
It will take time to grow
Maybe, I don't know

[Verse 4]

Hey, tonight, if you think about it again
Remembering all the times that you pointed out
Say, the glass is clear, but all this fear
Starts a-leaving a mark
Your idle hands are all that stands
From your time in the dark
But it's still alright
