Capo 5

F C F C F C G

F       C       F    G
turning in the grain again
    F     C        G
the bells begin to chime

F         C
time, she says,
         C          F
“there’s no turning back,
          C           G
keep your eyes on the tracks”
F           C       C                 F
through the fields, somewhere there’s blue
    C         G            F      C
oh, time will tell, she’ll see us through

howling out,
the windy hills
and all the time we took
you should know just how it steals
keep your hand on the wheel
and through it all, somewhere we knew
time will tell, she’ll see us through

    Am            Em                F
and all fire and flames took all we trust
      C          G
we’re kicking up dust
stations fade just like they do

    C         G         F     C      F  C
oh, time will tell, we always knew

oh, time will tell, we always knew
```
