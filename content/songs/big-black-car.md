Am riff

Am         G            F        C
You were a phonograph, I was a kid
I sat with an ear close, just listening
I was there when the rain tapped her way down your face            
You were a miracle I was just holdin your space
 
Am riff

Am         G            F        C
Well time has a way of throwing it all in your face
The past, she is haunted, the future is laced
Heartbreak, ya know, drives a big black car
Swear i was in the back seat, just minding my own

G                                                C
And through the glass, the corn crows come like rain
           G                Am  
They wont stay, they wont stay for 
Em       C
Too long now
               G           Am
This could be all that we know..
    D
Of love and all.
 
Am                G     F         C
Well you were a dancer, I was a rag
The song in my head, well was all that I had
Hope was a letter I never could send
Love was a country we couldn't defend
 
Am G F C
 
G                   F                  C              G
And through the carnival we watch them go round and round
                 F                C               G
All we knew of home was just a sunset and some clowns  ohhhhhhh
 
Am                 G       F        C
Well you were a magazine, I was a plain Jane
Just walking the sidewalks all covered in rain
love to just get into one of your stories
Just me and all of my plain Jane glory
Just me and all of my plain Jane glory
