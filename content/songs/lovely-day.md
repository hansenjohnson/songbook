Emaj7                 Dbm7
When I wake up in the morning, love
        Amaj7             Cmaj7  Bm7
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

Cmaj7           Bm7
Then I look at you
      Am7                 Bm7   
And the world's alright with me
Cmaj7           Bm7
Just one look at you
          Am7         Bm7
And I know it's gonna be

Emaj7   Db  Amaj7  Cmaj7  Bm7
A lovely day
A lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day
