G
Dashing through the snow
                      C
In a one horse open sleigh
                   D
O'er the fields we go
                  G
Laughing all the way
G
Bells on bob tails ring
                 C
Making spirits bright
C                   D
What fun it is to laugh and sing
C                   G
A sleighing song tonight

G
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
G
Jingle all the way
C               G
Oh, what fun it is to ride
     D              D
In a one horse open sleigh
G
Jingle bells, jingle bells
G
Jingle all the way
C                      G
Oh, what fun it is to ride
D             C     G
In a one horse open sleigh

G
A day or two ago
                     C
I thought I'd take a ride
                      D
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
                  G
Was seated by my side,

The horse was lean and lank
                      C
Misfortune seemed his lot
                      D
He got into a drifted bank
                G
And then we got upsot!

G
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
G
Jingle all the way
C               G
Oh, what fun it is to ride
     D              D
In a one horse open sleigh
G
Jingle bells, jingle bells
G
Jingle all the way
C                      G
Oh, what fun it is to ride
D             C     G
In a one horse open sleigh
