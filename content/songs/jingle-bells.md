G
Dashing through the snow
                      C
In a one horse open sleigh
                   D
O'er the fields we go
                  G
Laughing all the way
G
Bells on bob tails ring
                 C
Making spirits bright
C                   D
What fun it is to laugh and sing
C                   G
A sleighing song tonight

G
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
G
Jingle all the way
C               G
Oh, what fun it is to ride
     D              D
In a one horse open sleigh
G
Jingle bells, jingle bells
G
Jingle all the way
C                      G
Oh, what fun it is to ride
D             C     G
In a one horse open sleigh

(lesser-known verses follow with the same chord structure)

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side,
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot.

A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow,
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
and sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead
```
