Capo 2

D
I once had a girl
                 C        G  D
Or should I say she once had me
D
She showed me her room
                 C    G  D
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

Dmin
She asked me to stay
                          G
And she told me to sit anywhere
Dmin
So I looked around
                              Emin A
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
