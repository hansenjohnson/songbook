C                         Cmaj7
Something in the way she moves
C7                        F
Attracts me like no other lover
D                         G
Something in the way she woos me
Am            
I don't want to leave her now
Am
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

A
You're asking me will my love grow
        D       G
I don't know, I don't know
A
You stick around and it may show
        D       G
I don't know, I don't know

[Solo]

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
```
