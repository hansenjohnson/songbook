Capo 2
C F G C

[Verse 1]
Papa's in the kitchen, mama's in the field
Murder in the hen house, mud flung high upon the hill
Rooster in the dooryard just leaning on the horn
With the wind so sweetly drifting through the ripening corn

[Chorus]
Hey me, hey mama
Where you been for so long, for so long?
Hey me, hey mama
Where you been, where you been for so long?

[Verse 2]
There's something outrageous 'bout that evening sky
Just this side of dangerous that look in your eye
Knew that you were crazy, always knew you could b–µ cruel
Still, I would do just about anything in the world for you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Left me standing in the corner with my head hanging down
Punchdrunk, busted up, and reeling like a rodeo clown
You always seem to hit me like a lightning from above
Guess I just wasn't ready for such a heavy-handed love

[Chorus]
