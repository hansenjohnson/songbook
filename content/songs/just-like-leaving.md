```
[Verse 1]
The light's pourin' through my window dressin' everything all up in gold and I don’t know what I’m doing here
I left the howlin' winds and the prairies to find some kind of idea
Am I full or am I empty?

[Verse 2]
Well maybe I just like hurtin', buildin' up walls and then rippin' them down with my own disposition
My own hurtin' masks the way I feel about the world and all the little things I wish were different

[Chorus]
And I’ve been grievin' since I left old Carolina
The bars on my window didn’t leave me safe at night
Now I’ve chased your love 'cause I thought it might feel woolen
Like a dram on a damn cold winter's night

[Verse 3]
Wеll some things they just like lеavin', like people love and money and I don’t know what it’s all runnin' from
Perhaps the fear of splittin' open, showin' some parts of yourself that you don’t even really want to know

[Chorus]
