A                                       Em
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
F#                     A                  F#
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
D                   A
Strawberry Fields forever

E           Emaj7         E7        F#m     E             D
Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see
    F#m      E              A                   F#m
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
    F#m       E           D   A
It doesn't matter much to me

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think a "no" will mean a "yes" but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
