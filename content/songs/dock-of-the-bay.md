Capo 2 for duet

G                      B
Sittin' in the mornin' sun
        C                         A
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
G                       B
Watchin' the ships roll in
       C                    A
Then I watch 'em roll away again
     G                        E
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
             G          E
Watchin' the tide, roll away
    G                          A
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
       G        E
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
And I headed for the Frisco Bay
'Cause I've got nothin' to live for
Looks like nothin's gonna come my way, so
I'm just come sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay,
Wastin' time

G     D     C
Looks like nothin's gonna change
G       D         C
Everything seems to stay the same
G       D        C
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
    F           D
So I guess I'll remain the same

I'm sittin' here restin' my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
This two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home
Now I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
