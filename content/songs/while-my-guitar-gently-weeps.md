Capo 5th fret

Dm  (walkdown)
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
Dm        C             G  A
While my guitar gently weeps
Dm  (walkdown)
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Dm        C            F  A
Still my guitar gently weeps.

D            C#m Bm     F#m
I don't know why nobody told you
Em                 A
How to unfold your love
D            C#m Bm     F#m
I don't know how someone controlled you
Em                   A
They bought and sold you.

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you.

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps.
