[Verse]
E
In the twilight glow I see,
B                        E
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
E
When we kissed good-bye and parted
  B                      E
I knew we'd never meet again


[Chorus]

A
Love is like a dying ember
E               B7
Only memories remain
 E
And through the ages I'll remember
B7                        E
Blue eyes crying in the rain


[Instrumental]


[Chorus]

A
Someday when we meet up yonder
E                          B7
We'll stroll hand in hand again
E
In the land that knows no parting
B7                      E
Blue eyes crying in the rain.
B7                        A     A/Ab  A/F#  E  Esus  E
Blue eyes crying in the rain.
