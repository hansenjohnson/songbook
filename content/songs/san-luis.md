Capo 3

Em G C G C G

[Verse 1]

Em                  G     C
weightlessness, no gravity
        G           C
were we somewhere in-between

D*              
i’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me
  Am                G     C/G
a bird’s-eye view of San Luis

Em G C G C 
Oooooh (x2)

[Verse 2]

oh, highway boys all sleeping in
with their dirty mouths and broken strings
oh, their eyes are shining like the sea
for you, the queen of San Luis

i’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me
a bird’s-eye view of San Luis

Oooooh (x2)

[Bridge]

Bm
cutting through the avenues
C/G
i’d always find my way to you
Em                          G  C/G
beside the hook, the hammer lies

fumbling round in the smoke
spending time chasing ghosts
hold me down, hold me down, child
hold me down, hold me down, child

[Verse 3]

California called you queen
with your golden hair and magazine
were you somewhere in-between
fast asleep, a flying dream

i’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me
a bird’s-eye view of San Luis (x3)

Oooooh (x2)
