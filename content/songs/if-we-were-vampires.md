[Intro]

Am  Em  F
Am  Em  F
Am      C
Am      C   G

[Verse 1]
              Am            Em                F
It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in
        Am           Em          F
Or the light coming off of your skin
             Am                         C
The fragile heart you protected for so long
        Am                               C    G
Or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong
               Am              Em          F
It's not your hands searching slow in the dark
         Am            Em          F
Or your nails leaving love's watermark
              Am                      C
It's not the way you talk me off the roof
       Am                              C    G
Your questions like directions to the truth

[Chorus]
     F                                C
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
F                              C               G
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
F                             Am
Maybe we'll get forty years together
        G           F
But one day I'll be gone
                     C    G
Or one day you'll be gone

[Verse 2]
If we were vampires and death was a joke
We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke
Laugh at all the lovers and their plans
I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand
Maybe time running out is a gift
I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift
And give you every second I can find
And hope it isn't me who's left behind

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]
Am  Em  F
Am  Em  F
Am      C
Am      C   G 

[Chorus]
     F                                C
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
F                              C               G
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
F                             Am
Maybe we'll get forty years together
        G           F
But one day I'll be gone
                     Am
Or one day you'll be gone

[Outro]
(Am) Em  F
 Am  Em  F
