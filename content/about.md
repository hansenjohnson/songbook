My name's Hansen. I'm an ocean scientist and musician. See my
[personal website](http://hansenjohnson.org/) for more details about my work. This website is built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and based heavily off of the [Xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) template. It is currently hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and the source code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/hansenjohnson/songbook). Please feel free to share and use as you see fit, and don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:hansen.johnson@dal.ca)!
