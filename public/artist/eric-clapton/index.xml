      <description>What&#39;ll you do when you get lonely And nobody&#39;s waiting by your side? You&#39;ve been running and hiding much too long. You know it&#39;s just your foolish pride. Layla, you&#39;ve got me on my knees. Layla, I&#39;m begging, darling please. Layla, darling won&#39;t you ease my worried mind. I tried to give you consolation When your old man had let you down. Like a fool, I fell in love with you, Turned my whole world upside down.</description>
