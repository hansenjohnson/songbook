      <description>Sittin&#39; in the mornin&#39; sun I&#39;ll be sittin&#39; when the evenin&#39; comes Watchin&#39; the ships roll in Then I watch &#39;em roll away again I&#39;m sittin&#39; on the dock of the bay Watchin&#39; the tide, roll away I&#39;m sittin&#39; on the dock of the bay Wastin&#39; time I left my home in Georgia And I headed for the Frisco Bay &#39;Cause I&#39;ve got nothin&#39; to live for Looks like nothin&#39;s gonna come my way, so I&#39;m just come sittin&#39; on the dock of the bay Watchin&#39; the tide roll away I&#39;m sittin&#39; on the dock of the bay, Wastin&#39; time Looks like nothin&#39;s gonna change Everything seems to stay the same I can&#39;t do what ten people tell me to do So I guess I&#39;ll remain the same I&#39;m sittin&#39; here restin&#39; my bones And this loneliness won&#39;t leave me alone This two thousand miles I roamed Just to make this dock my home Now I&#39;m just sittin&#39; on the dock of the bay Watchin&#39; the tide roll away Sittin&#39; on the dock of the bay Wastin&#39; time  </description>
