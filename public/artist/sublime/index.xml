      <description>When you grab a hold of me Tell me that I&#39;ll never be set free But I&#39;m a parasite, Creep and crawl I step into the night. Two pints of booze Tell me are you a badfish too? Are you a badfish too? Ain&#39;t got no money to spend I hope the night will never end Lord knows I&#39;m weak Won&#39;t somebody get me off of this reef Baby you&#39;re a big blue whale Grab the reef when all duck diving fails I swim, but wish I&#39;d never learned The water&#39;s too polluted with the germs I dive deep when it&#39;s ten feet overhead Grab the reef underneath my bed (it&#39;s underneath my bed) Ain&#39;t got no quarrels with God Ain&#39;t got no time to grow old Lord knows I&#39;m weak Won&#39;t somebody get me off of this reef [Solo] Ain&#39;t got no quarrels with God Ain&#39;t got no time to get old Lord knows I&#39;m weak Won&#39;t somebody get me off of this reef  </description>
