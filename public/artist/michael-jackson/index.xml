      <description>Hey pretty baby with the high heels on You give me fever Like I&#39;ve never, ever known You&#39;re just a product of loveliness I like the groove of your walk, Your talk, your dress I feel your fever From miles around I&#39;ll pick you up in my car And we&#39;ll paint the town Just kiss me baby And tell me twice That you&#39;re the one for me The way you make me feel You really turn me on You knock me off of my feet My lonely days are gone I like the feelin&#39; you&#39;re givin&#39; me Just hold me baby and I&#39;m in ecstasy Oh I&#39;ll be workin&#39; from nine to five To buy you things to keep you by my side I never felt so in love before Just promise baby, you&#39;ll love me forevermore I swear I&#39;m keepin&#39; you satisfied &#39;Cause you&#39;re the one for me The way you make me feel You really turn me on You knock me off of my feet My lonely days are gone, Go on girl!</description>
