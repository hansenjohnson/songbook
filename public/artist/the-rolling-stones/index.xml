      <description>Take me to the station And put me on a train I&#39;ve got no expectations To pass through here again Once I was a rich man and Now I am so poor But never in my sweet short life Have I felt like this before You heart is like a diamond You throw your pearls at swine And as I watch you leaving me You pack my peace of mind Our love was like the water That splashes on a stone Our love is like our music It&#39;s here, and then it&#39;s gone So take me to the airport And put me on a plane I&#39;ve got no expectations To pass through here again  </description>

      <description>Childhood living is easy to do The things you wanted I bought them for you Graceless lady you know who I am You know I can&#39;t let you slide through my hands Wild horses couldn&#39;t drag me away Wild, wild horses couldn&#39;t drag me away I watched you suffer a dull aching pain Now you&#39;ve decided to show me the same No sweeping exit or offstage lines Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind Wild horses couldn&#39;t drag me away Wild, wild horses couldn&#39;t drag me away I know I&#39;ve dreamed you a sin and a lie I have my freedom but I don&#39;t have much time Faith has been broken tears must be cried Let&#39;s do some living after we die Wild horses couldn&#39;t drag me away Wild, wild horses we&#39;ll ride them some day Wild horses couldn&#39;t drag me away Wild, wild horses we&#39;ll ride them some day  </description>
