      <description>Old pirates, yes, they rob I Sold I to the merchant ships Minutes after they took I From the bottomless pit But my hand was made strong By the hand of the Almighty We forward in this generation Triumphantly Won&#39;t you help to sing These songs of freedom? &#39;Cause all I ever have Redemption songs Redemption songs Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery None but ourselves can free our minds Have no fear for atomic energy &#39;Cause none of them can stop the time How long shall they kill our prophets While we stand aside and look?</description>
