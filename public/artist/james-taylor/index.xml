      <description>Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone Susanne the plans they made put an end to you I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song I just can&#39;t remember who to send it to I&#39;ve seen fire and I&#39;ve seen rain I&#39;ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end I&#39;ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend But I always thought that I&#39;d see you again Won&#39;t you look down upon me, jesus You&#39;ve got to help me make a stand You&#39;ve just got to see me through another day My body&#39;s aching and my time is at hand And I won&#39;t make it any other way Oh, I&#39;ve seen fire and I&#39;ve seen rain I&#39;ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end I&#39;ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend But I always thought that I&#39;d see you again Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun Lord knows when the cold wind blows it&#39;ll turn your head around Well, there&#39;s hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things To come Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground Oh, I&#39;ve seen fire and I&#39;ve seen rain I&#39;ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end I&#39;ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend But I always thought that I&#39;d see you, baby, one more time again, now Thought I&#39;d see you one more time again There&#39;s just a few things coming my way this time around, now Thought I&#39;d see you, thought I&#39;d see you fire and rain, now  </description>
