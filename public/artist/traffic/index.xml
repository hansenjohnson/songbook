      <description>Seems I got to have a change of scene &#39;Cause every night I have the strangest dreams Imprisoned by the way it could have been Left here on my own or so it seems I got to leave before I start to scream But someone&#39;s locked the door and took the key You feelin&#39; alright? I&#39;m not feelin&#39; too good myself Well, you feelin&#39; alright? I&#39;m not feelin&#39; too good myself Boy you sure took me for one big ride Even now I sit and wonder why And when I think of you I start myself to cry out I just can&#39;t waste my time, I must keep dry Gotta stop believin&#39; in all your lies &#39;Cause there&#39;s too much to do before I die, hey You feelin&#39; alright?</description>
