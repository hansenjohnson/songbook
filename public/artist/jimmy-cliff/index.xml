      <description>Many rivers to cross But I can&#39;t seem to find my way over Wandering I am lost As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover Many rivers to cross And it&#39;s only my will that keeps me alive I&#39;ve been licked, washed up for years And I merely survive because of my pride And this loneliness won&#39;t leave me alone It&#39;s such a drag to be on your own My woman left me and she didn&#39;t say why Well I guess, I have to try Many rivers to cross But just where to begin, I&#39;m playing for time There are times I find myself Thinking of committing some dreadful crime Yes, I&#39;ve got many rivers to cross But I can&#39;t seem to find my way over Wandering I am lost As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover  </description>
