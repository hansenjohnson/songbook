<pre><code>I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
It's kinda funny
But they always seem to let you down
And I get discouraged
'Cause I never see you anymore
And I need your love, babe
That's all I'm living for, yeah

I didn't want to pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do
I want to be your lover
I want to be the only one that makes you come, running
I want to be your lover
I want to turn you on, turn you out
All night long, make you shout
Oh, lover, yeah!
I want to be the only one you come for

I want to be your brother
I want to be your mother and your sister, too
There ain't no other
That can do the things that I'll do to you
And I get discouraged
Cause you treat me just like a child
And they say I'm so shy, yeah
But with you I just go wild, ooo ooo ooo

I didn't want to pressure you, baby, no
But all I ever wanted to do
I want to be your lover
I want to be the only one that makes you come, running
I want to be your lover
I want to turn you on, turn you out
All night long make you shout
Oh, lover, yeah!
I want to be the only one you come for, yeah
