      <description>I ain&#39;t got no money I ain&#39;t like those other guys you hang around It&#39;s kinda funny But they always seem to let you down And I get discouraged &#39;Cause I never see you anymore And I need your love, babe That&#39;s all I&#39;m living for, yeah I didn&#39;t want to pressure you, baby But all I ever wanted to do I want to be your lover I want to be the only one that makes you come, running I want to be your lover I want to turn you on, turn you out All night long, make you shout Oh, lover, yeah!</description>
