      <description>Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these sunken eyes and learn to see All your life You were only waiting for this moment to be free Blackbird fly, blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night Blackbird fly, blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise You were only waiting for this moment to arise You were only waiting for this moment to arise  </description>

      <description>It&#39;s not the pale moon that excites me That thrills and delights me Oh no, it&#39;s just the nearness of you It isn&#39;t your sweet conversation That brings this sensation Oh no, it&#39;s just the nearness of you When you&#39;re in my arms And I feel you so close to me All my wildest dreams came true I need no soft lights to enchant me If you will only grant me The right to hold you ever so tight And to feel in the night The nearness of you  </description>

      <description>Take me to the station And put me on a train I&#39;ve got no expectations To pass through here again Once I was a rich man and Now I am so poor But never in my sweet short life Have I felt like this before You heart is like a diamond You throw your pearls at swine And as I watch you leaving me You pack my peace of mind Our love was like the water That splashes on a stone Our love is like our music It&#39;s here, and then it&#39;s gone So take me to the airport And put me on a plane I&#39;ve got no expectations To pass through here again  </description>

      <description>Childhood living is easy to do The things you wanted I bought them for you Graceless lady you know who I am You know I can&#39;t let you slide through my hands Wild horses couldn&#39;t drag me away Wild, wild horses couldn&#39;t drag me away I watched you suffer a dull aching pain Now you&#39;ve decided to show me the same No sweeping exit or offstage lines Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind Wild horses couldn&#39;t drag me away Wild, wild horses couldn&#39;t drag me away I know I&#39;ve dreamed you a sin and a lie I have my freedom but I don&#39;t have much time Faith has been broken tears must be cried Let&#39;s do some living after we die Wild horses couldn&#39;t drag me away Wild, wild horses we&#39;ll ride them some day Wild horses couldn&#39;t drag me away Wild, wild horses we&#39;ll ride them some day  </description>
