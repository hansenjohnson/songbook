      <description>G C G C G C D C G C G C I am an old woman named after my mother G C D G My old man is another child that&#39;s grown old If dreams were lightning thunder was desire This old house would have burnt down a long time ago G F C G Make me an angel that flies from Montgom&#39;ry G F C G Make me a poster of an old rodeo Just give me one thing that I can hold on to To believe in this living is just a hard way to go When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy He weren&#39;t much to look at, just free rambling man But that was a long time and no matter how I try The years just flow by like a broken down dam.</description>
