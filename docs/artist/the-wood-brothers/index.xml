      <description>My whole saturday and sunday too I was thinking about ways not to lose I lay down my weapons is what I&#39;ve done Too late to hide, feet too soft to run But people say I&#39;m the luckiest man Yeah they say Running is useless and fighting is foolish You&#39;re not gonna win but still you&#39;re the luckiest man you&#39;re up against And too many horses and mysterious forces What you don&#39;t know is you are the luckiest man You&#39;re the luckiest man I done talked to the devil when he calls my name But sometimes when I&#39;m losing it all seems the same And when I fall I&#39;m back up again Just to slip on the same mistakes and slide right back in But people say I&#39;m the luckiest man Yeah they say Running is useless and fighting is foolish You&#39;re not gonna win but still you&#39;re the luckiest man you&#39;re up against And too many horses and mysterious forces What you don&#39;t know is you are the luckiest man You&#39;re the luckiest man Try to keep my faith and keep my mind Hate to lose either one when the whip cracks behind And I can&#39;t help but mourning just a little each night People say everything is gonna be alright They say I&#39;m the luckiest man Yeah they say That running is useless and fighting is foolish You&#39;re not gonna win but still you&#39;re the luckiest man you&#39;re up against And too many horses and mysterious forces What you don&#39;t know is you are the luckiest man You&#39;re the luckiest man You&#39;re the luckiest man  </description>

      <description>As I sit on the edge of this never made bed Old guitar in my lap a new tune in my head There she stands in the doorway just brushin&#39; her hair It&#39;s my beautiful muse in her underwear And if I was thinkin&#39; I’d be thinkin&#39; thank God whoever you are For the muse and this old guitar Times like these so sweet and so true Thinkin’s the last thing that you wanna do As I sit on the end of this dirty old bar Tryin’ to work some things out and not gettin&#39; too far And I drown out the voices that are keepin&#39; me down There’s a muse all alone on the other side of town And if I was thinkin&#39; I’d be thinkin&#39; thank God whoever you are For all the whiskey in this dirty old bar Times like these so sad but so true Thinkin’s the last thing that you wanna do Thinkin’s the last thing that you wanna do As I sit on the bed in this hospital room Sheddin’ a tear for the bride and groom The tiniest voice starts to bellow and cry It’s my finest work yet if today I should die And if I was thinkin&#39; I’d be thinkin&#39; thank God whoever you are For the muse and the miracle right here in my arms Times like these so sweet and so true Thinkin’s the last thing that you wanna do Thinkin’s the last thing that you wanna do Thinkin’s the last thing that you wanna do  </description>
