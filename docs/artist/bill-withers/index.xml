      <description>When I wake up in the morning, love And the sunlight hurts my eyes And something without warning, love Bears heavy on my mind Then I look at you And the world&#39;s alright with me Just one look at you And I know it&#39;s gonna be A lovely day A lovely day When the day that lies ahead of me Seems impossible to face When someone else instead of me Always seems to know the way Then I look at you And the world&#39;s alright with me Just one look at you And I know it&#39;s gonna be A lovely day A lovely day When the day that lies ahead of me Seems impossible to face When someone else instead of me Always seems to know the way Then I look at you And the world&#39;s alright with me Just one look at you And I know it&#39;s gonna be A lovely day A lovely day  </description>
