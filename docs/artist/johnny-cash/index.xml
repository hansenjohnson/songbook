      <description>I hear the train a comin&#39; It&#39;s rollin&#39; &#39;round the bend, And I ain&#39;t seen the sunshine Since, I don&#39;t know when I&#39;m stuck in Folsom Prison And time keeps draggin&#39; on But that train keeps a-rollin&#39; On down to San Antone When I was just a baby My Mama told me, &amp;quot;Son Always be a good boy Don&#39;t ever play with guns, &amp;quot; But I shot a man in Reno Just to watch him die When I hear that whistle blowin&#39; I hang my head and cry I bet there&#39;s rich folks eatin&#39; In a fancy dining car They&#39;re probably drinkin&#39; coffee And smokin&#39; big cigars But I know I had it comin&#39; I know I can&#39;t be free But those people keep a-movin&#39; And that&#39;s what tortures me Well, if they freed me from this prison If that railroad train was mine I bet I&#39;d move out over a little Farther down the line Far from Folsom Prison That&#39;s where I want to stay And I&#39;d let that lonesome whistle Blow my blues away  </description>
