      <description>I seem to recognize your face Haunting, familiar yet I can&#39;t seem to place it Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name Lifetimes are catching up with me All these changes taking place I wish I&#39;d seen the place But no one&#39;s ever taken me Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away I swear, I recognize your breath Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising Me, you wouldn&#39;t recall for I&#39;m not my former It&#39;s hard when you&#39;re stuck upon the shelf I changed by not changing at all Small town predicts my fate Perhaps that&#39;s what no one wants to see I just want to scream hello My God it&#39;s been so long Never dreamed you&#39;d return But now here you are and here I am Hearts and thoughts they fade away Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away Hearts and thoughts they fade away  </description>
