      <description>Trailer for sale or rent, rooms to let, fifty cents. No phone, no pool, no pets, I ain&#39;t got no cigarettes Ah, but, two hours of pushin&#39; broom Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room I&#39;m a man of means by no means, king of the road. Third boxcar, midnight train, destination, Bangor, Maine. Old worn out clothes and shoes, I don&#39;t pay no union dues, I smoke old stogies I have found short, but not too big around I&#39;m a man of means by no means, king of the road.</description>
