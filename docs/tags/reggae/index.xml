      <description>When you grab a hold of me Tell me that I&#39;ll never be set free But I&#39;m a parasite, Creep and crawl I step into the night. Two pints of booze Tell me are you a badfish too? Are you a badfish too? Ain&#39;t got no money to spend I hope the night will never end Lord knows I&#39;m weak Won&#39;t somebody get me off of this reef Baby you&#39;re a big blue whale Grab the reef when all duck diving fails I swim, but wish I&#39;d never learned The water&#39;s too polluted with the germs I dive deep when it&#39;s ten feet overhead Grab the reef underneath my bed (it&#39;s underneath my bed) Ain&#39;t got no quarrels with God Ain&#39;t got no time to grow old Lord knows I&#39;m weak Won&#39;t somebody get me off of this reef [Solo] Ain&#39;t got no quarrels with God Ain&#39;t got no time to get old Lord knows I&#39;m weak Won&#39;t somebody get me off of this reef  </description>

      <description>Many rivers to cross But I can&#39;t seem to find my way over Wandering I am lost As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover Many rivers to cross And it&#39;s only my will that keeps me alive I&#39;ve been licked, washed up for years And I merely survive because of my pride And this loneliness won&#39;t leave me alone It&#39;s such a drag to be on your own My woman left me and she didn&#39;t say why Well I guess, I have to try Many rivers to cross But just where to begin, I&#39;m playing for time There are times I find myself Thinking of committing some dreadful crime Yes, I&#39;ve got many rivers to cross But I can&#39;t seem to find my way over Wandering I am lost As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover  </description>

      <description>Old pirates, yes, they rob I Sold I to the merchant ships Minutes after they took I From the bottomless pit But my hand was made strong By the hand of the Almighty We forward in this generation Triumphantly Won&#39;t you help to sing These songs of freedom? &#39;Cause all I ever have Redemption songs Redemption songs Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery None but ourselves can free our minds Have no fear for atomic energy &#39;Cause none of them can stop the time How long shall they kill our prophets While we stand aside and look?</description>
