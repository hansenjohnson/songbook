      <description>G C G C G C D C G C G C I am an old woman named after my mother G C D G My old man is another child that&#39;s grown old If dreams were lightning thunder was desire This old house would have burnt down a long time ago G F C G Make me an angel that flies from Montgom&#39;ry G F C G Make me a poster of an old rodeo Just give me one thing that I can hold on to To believe in this living is just a hard way to go When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy He weren&#39;t much to look at, just free rambling man But that was a long time and no matter how I try The years just flow by like a broken down dam.</description>

      <description>Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone Susanne the plans they made put an end to you I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song I just can&#39;t remember who to send it to I&#39;ve seen fire and I&#39;ve seen rain I&#39;ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end I&#39;ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend But I always thought that I&#39;d see you again Won&#39;t you look down upon me, jesus You&#39;ve got to help me make a stand You&#39;ve just got to see me through another day My body&#39;s aching and my time is at hand And I won&#39;t make it any other way Oh, I&#39;ve seen fire and I&#39;ve seen rain I&#39;ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end I&#39;ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend But I always thought that I&#39;d see you again Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun Lord knows when the cold wind blows it&#39;ll turn your head around Well, there&#39;s hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things To come Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground Oh, I&#39;ve seen fire and I&#39;ve seen rain I&#39;ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end I&#39;ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend But I always thought that I&#39;d see you, baby, one more time again, now Thought I&#39;d see you one more time again There&#39;s just a few things coming my way this time around, now Thought I&#39;d see you, thought I&#39;d see you fire and rain, now  </description>

      <description>I hear the train a comin&#39; It&#39;s rollin&#39; &#39;round the bend, And I ain&#39;t seen the sunshine Since, I don&#39;t know when I&#39;m stuck in Folsom Prison And time keeps draggin&#39; on But that train keeps a-rollin&#39; On down to San Antone When I was just a baby My Mama told me, &amp;quot;Son Always be a good boy Don&#39;t ever play with guns, &amp;quot; But I shot a man in Reno Just to watch him die When I hear that whistle blowin&#39; I hang my head and cry I bet there&#39;s rich folks eatin&#39; In a fancy dining car They&#39;re probably drinkin&#39; coffee And smokin&#39; big cigars But I know I had it comin&#39; I know I can&#39;t be free But those people keep a-movin&#39; And that&#39;s what tortures me Well, if they freed me from this prison If that railroad train was mine I bet I&#39;d move out over a little Farther down the line Far from Folsom Prison That&#39;s where I want to stay And I&#39;d let that lonesome whistle Blow my blues away  </description>

      <description>Trailer for sale or rent, rooms to let, fifty cents. No phone, no pool, no pets, I ain&#39;t got no cigarettes Ah, but, two hours of pushin&#39; broom Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room I&#39;m a man of means by no means, king of the road. Third boxcar, midnight train, destination, Bangor, Maine. Old worn out clothes and shoes, I don&#39;t pay no union dues, I smoke old stogies I have found short, but not too big around I&#39;m a man of means by no means, king of the road.</description>

      <description>My whole saturday and sunday too I was thinking about ways not to lose I lay down my weapons is what I&#39;ve done Too late to hide, feet too soft to run But people say I&#39;m the luckiest man Yeah they say Running is useless and fighting is foolish You&#39;re not gonna win but still you&#39;re the luckiest man you&#39;re up against And too many horses and mysterious forces What you don&#39;t know is you are the luckiest man You&#39;re the luckiest man I done talked to the devil when he calls my name But sometimes when I&#39;m losing it all seems the same And when I fall I&#39;m back up again Just to slip on the same mistakes and slide right back in But people say I&#39;m the luckiest man Yeah they say Running is useless and fighting is foolish You&#39;re not gonna win but still you&#39;re the luckiest man you&#39;re up against And too many horses and mysterious forces What you don&#39;t know is you are the luckiest man You&#39;re the luckiest man Try to keep my faith and keep my mind Hate to lose either one when the whip cracks behind And I can&#39;t help but mourning just a little each night People say everything is gonna be alright They say I&#39;m the luckiest man Yeah they say That running is useless and fighting is foolish You&#39;re not gonna win but still you&#39;re the luckiest man you&#39;re up against And too many horses and mysterious forces What you don&#39;t know is you are the luckiest man You&#39;re the luckiest man You&#39;re the luckiest man  </description>

      <description>As I sit on the edge of this never made bed Old guitar in my lap a new tune in my head There she stands in the doorway just brushin&#39; her hair It&#39;s my beautiful muse in her underwear And if I was thinkin&#39; I’d be thinkin&#39; thank God whoever you are For the muse and this old guitar Times like these so sweet and so true Thinkin’s the last thing that you wanna do As I sit on the end of this dirty old bar Tryin’ to work some things out and not gettin&#39; too far And I drown out the voices that are keepin&#39; me down There’s a muse all alone on the other side of town And if I was thinkin&#39; I’d be thinkin&#39; thank God whoever you are For all the whiskey in this dirty old bar Times like these so sad but so true Thinkin’s the last thing that you wanna do Thinkin’s the last thing that you wanna do As I sit on the bed in this hospital room Sheddin’ a tear for the bride and groom The tiniest voice starts to bellow and cry It’s my finest work yet if today I should die And if I was thinkin&#39; I’d be thinkin&#39; thank God whoever you are For the muse and the miracle right here in my arms Times like these so sweet and so true Thinkin’s the last thing that you wanna do Thinkin’s the last thing that you wanna do Thinkin’s the last thing that you wanna do  </description>
