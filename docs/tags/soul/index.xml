      <description>Sittin&#39; in the mornin&#39; sun I&#39;ll be sittin&#39; when the evenin&#39; comes Watchin&#39; the ships roll in Then I watch &#39;em roll away again I&#39;m sittin&#39; on the dock of the bay Watchin&#39; the tide, roll away I&#39;m sittin&#39; on the dock of the bay Wastin&#39; time I left my home in Georgia And I headed for the Frisco Bay &#39;Cause I&#39;ve got nothin&#39; to live for Looks like nothin&#39;s gonna come my way, so I&#39;m just come sittin&#39; on the dock of the bay Watchin&#39; the tide roll away I&#39;m sittin&#39; on the dock of the bay, Wastin&#39; time Looks like nothin&#39;s gonna change Everything seems to stay the same I can&#39;t do what ten people tell me to do So I guess I&#39;ll remain the same I&#39;m sittin&#39; here restin&#39; my bones And this loneliness won&#39;t leave me alone This two thousand miles I roamed Just to make this dock my home Now I&#39;m just sittin&#39; on the dock of the bay Watchin&#39; the tide roll away Sittin&#39; on the dock of the bay Wastin&#39; time  </description>

      <description>When I wake up in the morning, love And the sunlight hurts my eyes And something without warning, love Bears heavy on my mind Then I look at you And the world&#39;s alright with me Just one look at you And I know it&#39;s gonna be A lovely day A lovely day When the day that lies ahead of me Seems impossible to face When someone else instead of me Always seems to know the way Then I look at you And the world&#39;s alright with me Just one look at you And I know it&#39;s gonna be A lovely day A lovely day When the day that lies ahead of me Seems impossible to face When someone else instead of me Always seems to know the way Then I look at you And the world&#39;s alright with me Just one look at you And I know it&#39;s gonna be A lovely day A lovely day  </description>

      <description>   I never meant to cause you any sorrow I never meant to cause you any pain I only wanted to one time to see you laughing I only wanted to see you Laughing in the purple rain Purple rain, purple rain Purple rain, purple rain Purple rain, purple rain I only wanted to see you Bathing in the purple rain I never wanted to be your weekend lover I only wanted to be some kind of friend Baby, I could never steal you from another It&#39;s such a shame our friendship had to end Purple rain, purple rain Purple rain, purple rain Purple rain, purple rain I only wanted to see you Underneath the purple rain Honey, I know, I know I know times are changing It&#39;s time we all reach out For something new, that means you too You say you want a leader But you can&#39;t seem to make up your mind I think you better close it And let me guide you to the purple rain Purple rain, purple rain Purple rain, purple rain If you know what I&#39;m singing about up here C&#39;mon, raise your hand Purple rain, purple rain I only want to see you Only want to see you In the purple rain  </description>
