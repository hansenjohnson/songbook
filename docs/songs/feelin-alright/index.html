<pre><code>Seems I got to have a change of scene
'Cause every night I have the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way it could have been
Left here on my own or so it seems
I got to leave before I start to scream
But someone's locked the door and took the key

You feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Boy you sure took me for one big ride
Even now I sit and wonder why

And when I think of you I start myself to cry out
I just can't waste my time, I must keep dry
Gotta stop believin' in all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die, hey

You feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
You feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good
Don't get too lost in all I say

Though at the time I really felt that way
But that was then, and now you know it's today
I can't get off, I guess I'm here to stay
'Til someone comes along and takes my place, yeah
With a different name, oh, and a different face

You feelin' alright?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Yeah, not feeling too good myself
Oh, woah, I'm not, well I'm not feeling good myself
You can turn away, feeling, almighty I'm not feeling too good myself
